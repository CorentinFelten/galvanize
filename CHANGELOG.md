# Changelog

## vX.X.X (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Added
- `GET /admin/version` returns the running version (`{"version": "0.7.3"}`), e.g. for Zync to check compatibility. It requires an admin token: requests without a valid token get 401 and player tokens 403, so the version is never disclosed to players or unauthenticated clients

### Changed
- The API port no longer serves `/metrics`, which was exempt from authentication and exposed challenge names and team IDs to anyone who could reach the API. Metrics stay on the metrics server (port 5001, basic auth when `metrics.password` is set), which the provided Prometheus configuration already scrapes

### Fixed
- Connection info lists every endpoint of an instance, one per line, ordered by compose service: each Traefik-routed host as `https://<host>/`, then each published port as `<scheme>://<host>:<port>` (its protocol hint, or `tcp`/`udp`). Only the first container with a route or a published port was reported, so a challenge with, for example, a web front end and an SSH service showed only one of them, depending on the order Ansible listed the containers. Only routers' `.rule` labels are read, so other Traefik labels set by challenge authors (entrypoints, tls, middlewares) no longer make the route random, and containers with `traefik.enable=false` are skipped

## v0.7.3 (2026-10-01)

### Fixed
- The default of `deployment_max_extensions` is now 3, as documented in `config.example.yaml`: the code defaulted to 4
- Without Redis, expired deployments are now terminated: the expiry scheduler had no way to run a termination without the job queue, so it only marked them as errors ("no job queue configured for termination") and left their containers running
- A panic in a request handler now returns a 500 response and is logged with its stack trace: the recovery middleware was commented out, so the connection was dropped without a response
- `/admin/deploy-all` now lists the category and name of each challenge it deploys: its `challenges` entries were empty (`{"category": "", "challenge_name": ""}`). `/admin/deploy-all` and `/admin/terminate-all` return `"challenges": []` instead of `null` when there is nothing to do
- `/extend` refuses a deployment that is not running (starting, stopping or failed) with a 400 "deployment is not running", counted as `not_running` in the extension rejection metric: it extended any deployment and always answered with status `running`
- The `tcp` playbook no longer requires `traefik_network`: it declared that network in the compose definition although TCP services run on the bridge network and never join it, so TCP challenges failed to deploy when it was not set
- The Docker image's default command now starts the server (`serve --port 8080 --config data/config.yaml`): it passed the port as an argument, which `serve` rejects (`unknown command "8080"`), so the image only worked with an explicit command
- `max_concurrent_ansible` is now honored: without Redis, at most that many Ansible runs (default 5) run at once for team deploys, team terminations and expiries, the others waiting for a slot. Admin actions are not limited. The setting was read but never used, so these runs were unbounded
- The published port bindings store no longer leaks a SQLite connection, and its file descriptor, on every deploy and terminate: it opened a new connection pool for each call and never closed it. It now keeps one per database file

## v0.7.2 (2026-10-01)

### Changed
- Docker Compose project names, which also name the subdomains of instances, now include the category and a hash of the instance's identity (e.g. `polypwn-web-login-team1-<hash>`). Instances already running when upgrading keep their previous name: terminating them also removes the project under that name, so no containers are left behind
- `/admin/reload-challs` returns `{"indexed": <count>, "skipped": [{"path", "reason"}]}` instead of an empty body
- A deployment that cannot get a randomized host port (no free port left in the range, or the port bindings store cannot be opened) now fails with a clear error, instead of publishing the port on an ephemeral host port outside the range

### Fixed
- Deployments failing on Docker Compose 2.38+ with `can't set distinct values on 'pids_limit' and 'deploy.resources.limits.pids'`: the PID limit is now set as `deploy.resources.limits.pids`, next to the CPU and memory limits, instead of the service-level `pids_limit`. The `custom_compose` playbook drops a `pids_limit` set in the challenge's own compose file, so Galvanize's limit applies as before
- Same-named challenges in different categories no longer collide: the category is now part of the deploy and terminate check against the JWT (a token for `web/login` cannot deploy or terminate `pwn/login`), of the per-instance lock, and of the Docker Compose project name
- Compose project names end with a real hash of the instance's identity: the previous suffix was always `706f6c`, since `sha1.New().Sum(name)` appended the hash of nothing to the name instead of hashing it. Names are also cut to fit a 63-character DNS label
- One invalid `challenge.yml` no longer takes every challenge down: it stopped Galvanize from starting, or made `/admin/reload-challs` fail. Files that cannot be parsed (including a bad compose file), unreadable directories and challenges declaring an already indexed `category/name` are now skipped and logged, and the other challenges are indexed
- A missing or unreadable challenge directory makes `BuildIndex` return an error instead of panicking; a failed reload keeps the current index
- `randomized_port_min` and `randomized_port_max` are now honored: randomized host ports were always picked from 20000-60999. Each bound still defaults (20000 and 60999) when unset; an invalid range (outside 1-65535, or a minimum above the maximum) fails startup, and a config reload with one keeps the current config. When random picks keep colliding, a free port of the range is taken in order, so a nearly full range is still used up
- `models.GetExpiredDeployments` queried a column that does not exist (`expired_at` instead of `expires_at`), so it always failed. It now shares `models.GetDeploymentsExpiringBy` with the expiry scheduler, and like it leaves out unique deployments, which never expire

## v0.7.1 (2026-06-02)

### Added
- Auto-detect a standalone Docker Compose file (`compose.yaml`, `compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yaml`, or `docker-compose.yml`) next to `challenge.yml` for multi-service challenges, so authors no longer have to embed the whole document as an inline `compose_definition` string
- Optional `deploy_parameters.compose_file` to point at a differently named compose file (relative to the challenge directory)
- Default `playbook_name` to `custom_compose` when a compose file is detected and no playbook is set explicitly
- `deploy_parameters.expose` block for compose challenges: automatically wire Traefik (http: external network + router/service labels + domain) and published ports (tcp: reuses per-team host-port randomization/persistence), removing the need to hand-write Traefik labels, attach networks, or pick host ports. Multiple HTTP exposures get per-service subdomains, and connection info is derived automatically
- Validate `expose` entries at challenge index time (structure + that referenced services exist in the compose definition)
- Document `traefik_network` in `config.example.yaml` (required for http challenges and http exposures)

### Changed
- `example/custom_compose` now demonstrates the standalone `docker-compose.yml` workflow with an `expose` block; inline `compose_definition` still works and takes precedence over a sibling file

## v0.7.0 (2026-03-18)

### Added
- Configurable container resource limits (CPU, memory, PID) with global defaults in `config.yaml` and per-challenge overrides in `deploy_parameters.resource_limits`
- Optional `http_port` in `deploy_parameters` to configure which container port Traefik routes HTTP traffic to (defaults to 80)
- Per-playbook example `challenge.yml` files (`example/http`, `example/tcp`, `example/custom_compose`)

## v0.6.0 (2026-03-14)
### Added
- Bake `data/playbooks` into the `galvanize-instancer` runtime image so default playbooks are available even without a host bind mount
- Support optional protocol hints for TCP `published_ports` (for example `22/ssh` or `8080:80/http`) and use the hint in generated connection info URLs
- Add optional global `instancer.randomize_published_ports` config flag to randomize host port bindings for non-fixed TCP `published_ports` entries

### Changed
- Normalize hinted `published_ports` before running Ansible so Docker Compose still receives valid port syntax while preserving protocol hints for connection string rendering
- Persist randomized host-port bindings in SQLite so deploy retries and instancer restarts reuse the same published ports until terminate
- Prune stale `published_port_bindings` rows on startup when no matching non-deleted deployment exists

## v0.5.6 (2026-03-02)
### Fixed
- Database initialization failure: automatically create parent directory for SQLite database file to prevent "out of memory (14)" error when `db_path` directory doesn't exist

## v0.5.5 (2026-02-20)
### Changed

## v0.5.0 (2026-02-18)

### Added
- Prometheus metrics endpoint on port **5001** (`/metrics`) with optional HTTP Basic Auth (`instancer.metrics.username` / `instancer.metrics.password` in config)
- Deployment count gauge (`instancer_deployments`) backed by the database, grouped by status / category / challenge / team
- Deploy and terminate operation counters (`instancer_deploy_ops_total`, `instancer_terminate_ops_total`) with `result` label
- Deploy and terminate duration histograms (`instancer_deploy_duration_seconds`, `instancer_terminate_duration_seconds`) with category / challenge / team labels
- Deploy conflict counter (`instancer_deploy_conflict_total`) for 409 responses
- Unauthorized deploy request counter (`instancer_unauthorized_deploy_requests_total`) per team
- Extension operation counter (`instancer_extend_ops_total`) and rejection counter (`instancer_extend_rejected_total`) with `reason` label (`window_not_reached`, `no_extensions_left`, `already_expired`)
- Deployment lifetime histogram (`instancer_deployment_lifetime_seconds`) recorded at termination time
- Worker job retry counter (`instancer_job_retries_total`) and permanent failure counter (`instancer_job_permanent_failures_total`) with `job_type` label
- Redis queue depth gauge (`instancer_queue_depth`) and queue wait time histogram (`instancer_job_queue_wait_seconds`) — only registered when Redis is configured
- Challenge index size gauge (`instancer_challenges_indexed`) per category, updated on startup and on challenge reload
- Grafana monitoring stack (`docker-compose.monitoring.yml`) with Prometheus + Grafana, pre-provisioned with a full dashboard covering all metrics
- `make monitoring-up` / `make monitoring-down` targets

### Fixed
- TCP playbook (and any playbook using `{{ env | default({}) }}`): challenges without an `env` key in `deploy_parameters` no longer fail with *"environment must be a mapping"* — `env` is now normalised to an empty map before being passed to Ansible
